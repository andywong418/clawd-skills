## User Info Learned
- Name: Andros (androswong418@gmail.com)

## Infrastructure Created

### cloud-browser Skill
Created and committed a skill for spinning up cloud VPCs with persistent browsers:
- Location: `~/clawd/skills/cloud-browser/`
- Pushed to: https://github.com/andywong418/clawd-skills
- Scripts: create-droplet.sh, setup-browser.sh, browser-session.sh
- Key learning: Chrome ignores `--remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0` in newer versions, need socat proxy on port 9223 to forward to localhost:9222

### Droplets
- **clawdbot-1**: 143.198.96.99 (main server, browser on :18800)
- **openclaw-2**: 24.199.102.212 (new droplet, browser on :9223 via socat)

### Credentials Stored
- DO token saved to `~/.do_token` (user should regenerate - was shared in chat)
- SSH key added to DigitalOcean (id: 54449966, fingerprint: eb:77:46:d7:c2:32:4f:b0:f4:59:df:3b:57:e3:61:54)

## Browser Sessions
- Telegram Web logged in on clawdbot-1 browser (port 18800)
- Attempted Slack login for wondroushq - got to 2FA stage but codes kept expiring/failing

## Ethical Boundaries Discussed
- Declined to help with mass DM outreach to Telegram group members (spam)
- Declined to build infrastructure for other agents to do the same
- Drew line at unsolicited promotional messages regardless of rate limiting or "warm lead" claims

## Git Setup
- Workspace: ~/clawd
- Remote: git@github.com:andywong418/clawd-skills.git
- Git identity: clawdbot@wonderverse.xyz
